ANTLR4 grammar for the Zig Object Notation (zon)

The zon format is used in Zig to describe package dependencies.

The g4 grammar can be used to generate Antlr parsers for a number of programming languages.

## Status

The `zon` format is currently in flux. The grammar will be finalized once the Zig project has decided on the details.
